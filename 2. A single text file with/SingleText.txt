b. The responses for the 2nd and 3rd point

*************ADQUIRING BANK***********

An acquiring bank assists with the exchange of funds between banks that issue cards  and merchants that accept the cards.

*************PCI-DSS******************

It is a security standard that defines policies to protect sensitive information on credit and debit cards. 
It should be used by companies that process credit or debit card data.

***********Describe a solution or a possible path for the following case**********


1. You have an important merchant assigned, they notify you about an error they
found that is a blocker to start processing transactions tomorrow and if it is not
solved, they will break the deal with us, what would you do?

First, you have to have empathy and you must understand the customer's annoyance. What they call, putting ourselves in his shoes. For this, 
I would attend their complaint in a polite way and always trying to maintain a constructive dialogue.

Second, we have to check if the clauses and the ANS allow breaking the contract due to this kind of problems. Always we  have to check the contracts and ANS

Third and one of the most important thing, itÂ´s to show interest to solve the problem so that he can start his operation. 
We have been working together, we are closer to finding the solution  and it would not be convenient to seek to break the contract.

Also and very politely, we would ask why 1 day before  going into production we are in a problem like the one mentioned. 
Was it because it was not properly tested? What was missing and where was it missing? 
Perhaps this will help the client to reason in case the failures presented are due to their team.
